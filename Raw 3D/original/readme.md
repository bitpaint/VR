Files in this directory are raw and not compatible with Unity as they are.
You can download them and try to create a .unitypackage with them, this would help us.

If you have any 3D files you want to add (raw on .unitypackage) : create a pull request.
If you have converted any of thoses raw files into .unitypackage: also create a pull request.

Thank you for contributing.
